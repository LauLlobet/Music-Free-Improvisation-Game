# Volume from the mic of your phone gets sent to PdAndroidParty patch of a "server phone"

Music game where each player visits a web (192.168.1.N/main.html) puts his cellphone in front of their instrument speaker.
A server phone (with node for android and serves the main.html) recives all the volume levels of each players connected phone and sends its values to PdAndroidPary App
The PdAndroid Party patch plays a loud sound each time two performers are playing simultaneously.
